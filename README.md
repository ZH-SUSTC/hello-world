My first repository

Hellow world!

Now, I'm a sophomore in Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.And this is my first GitHub repository.During the study of Java last semester, I found that i'm interseted in computer science, so maybe my major in my undergraduate course would be computer science.
Hello, world.
